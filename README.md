# NCSA Mosaic byChromium
A Chromium-based browser with a retro NCSA Mosaic design

## ⚠️Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with NCSA or the University of Illinois and is released as a non-profit open source project.And I have the utmost respect for both of them.(It's still in its early stages, so there are many parts missing and the code has bugs, so use it at your own risk.)
##The reason for this project (in my opinion)
I decided to undertake this project because I believe there are few practical things that can easily recall the past.What I want to achieve with this project is a nostalgia for the past and The practicality that comes with it
