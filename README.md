# NCSA Mosaic byChromium
A Chromium-based browser with a retro NCSA Mosaic design

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is **unofficial** and not affiliated with NCSA or the University of Illinois. It is released purely as a non-profit, open-source project, and I hold the utmost respect for both institutions.
I'm currently planning to apply for permission to use graphic assets such as icons and logos from the University of Illinois. I won't release it until I get permission.

**(Caution: This is an early stage, work-in-progress project. It contains missing features and bugs. Use at your own risk.)**

## The Motivation Behind This Project
I decided to undertake this project because I believe there are few practical things that can easily recall the past. What I aim to achieve is a sense of nostalgia for the past, combined with the modern practicality that comes with it.

## Contributing (Help Wanted!)
I want this project to be large scale and known by everyone, so please get involved! :)

The initial release has many unimplemented parts, and any help with code, testing, or documentation is greatly appreciated.
